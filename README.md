Rooster is a badly written bot for jabber.

Included (for various reasons because outdated or modifications I had to make) are evelink and sleekxmpp

Required modules (so far) are sqlite3, arrow, beautifulsoup4, and requests

Also required is the EVE SDE in sqlite format (named static.db and in the root directory)

All isk donations can be sent to Chainsaw McGinny, all criticism can be sent to Rina Kondur.

To run, rename config.py.dst to config.py, edit required information (using full jid's in most cases) and run err.py

As per Errbot, local testing/running can be accomplished with the -T flag to err.py

Rooster requires python3 and is not compatible with 2.7.

Hue?
